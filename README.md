# NPG

NPG stands for _Node Project Generator_. I created this bash script in order to generate my very own Node.js projects with a previously established configuration. NPG wasn't created to fulfill general preferences, just personal (mine). That being said, it can be heavily modified anytime in order to fit those personal preferences.

## :sparkles: Features

-   Tests with Jest
-   Continuous integration with CircleCI
-   Code coverage with Codecov
-   ECMAScript 2015+ code compiling with Babel
-   Linting with eslint, prettier and Airbnb style guide
-   Static type checking with Flow

## Inspiration

Github templates are good, but I had to modify lots of pieces in my code to fit every project. There's no CLI that I like out there so I decide to create my own project generator.
